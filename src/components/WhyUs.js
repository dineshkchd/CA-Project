              Just as most people entrust their cars to professional mechanics
              for maintenance, small businesses require the expertise of
              professional accountants to ensure smooth operations and identify
              potential issues. Similar to servicing your car at its authorized
              station for comprehensive care, we offer a range of services under
              one roof to address all your business's legal and financial needs.

              <h5>Keep Your Business Healthy by regular monitoring</h5>
              <p>
                We do more than just tax filing. We take a comprehensive
                assessment of your finances and create a forecast through the
                year to keep your business in a healthy and prosperous state. It
                may feel daunting to let an outsider intimate details of how
                your business is run, especially if you’ve had trouble managing
                your finances in the past. But partnering with Purminder Kaur &
                Associates will actually help you to achieve your goals and set
                you up for long-term success.

              <h5>Get all your deductions and reduce tax liability</h5>
              <p>
                During a busy tax season, most business owners are frantically
                thinking about how they can maximize on their deductions.
                However, by the end of the year it is too late to make an impact
                on that. We support you by easily identifying these potential
                deductions throughout the year and advise you how to make
                strategic decisions for year-end deductions. Many business
                owners forget to track and account for items like depreciation,
                out-of-pocket expenses and home office space. Don’t leave money
                on the table!

              <p>
                Most entrepreneurs think that a tight budget means they won’t be
                able to afford hiring an accountant. But if you think about how
                much time and effort you spend on trying to manage your finances
                yourself (not to mention the possible errors you could incur
                during reporting, and related losses from poor financial
                decisions), the benefits certainly outweigh the cost. As an
                entrepreneur, your focus should be on running your business.
                Investing with us and engaging us as an ongoing tactical
                business advisor will assist you in maintaining that focus and
                simultaneously keep you on the road toward your business goals.

              <p>
                When business owners often tell us that they wish they could
                easily calculate the potential consequences and implications of
                making a big office purchase or hiring more employees. Having us
                as your financial advisor to help you with budgeting and
                monitoring cash flow on a steady basis will allow you to
                navigate any hurdles that occur in real time. You can take a
                collaborative approach with us, allowing you to make decisions
                together based on the latest data and also take advantage of a
                consultative relationship that will help you make business
                decisions when you need to make them.

              <p>
                Finally, one of the biggest benefits of hiring us is getting
                advice on how to plan for the future. Together, we can pull
                reports from past months and examine the seasonality of your
                business. Doing this will help you determine the best time to
                buy inventory, and budget for big-ticket investments so that you
                can stay competitive and viable. As a business owner, you are
                most often preoccupied with the day-to-day operations of running
                your business. However, we take a step back and objectively look
                at the big picture to find the best way to support the longevity
                of your business.
